# Anthares Kwai Runner

Public, disposable Android runner for the Universo Anthares Kwai publishing pipeline.

This repository contains only generic runner infrastructure. Account credentials, private controller URLs, private application logic and publishing policy remain outside the repository.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:
- KWAI_LOGIN
- KWAI_PASSWORD
- ANTHARES_CONTROL_URL
- ANTHARES_CONTROL_TOKEN

The runner downloads the validated Kwai package from this repository's public `kwai-package-vault` release and verifies its pinned SHA-256 before installation. No private-repository token is required.
